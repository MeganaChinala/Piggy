// This menu is called on by NewInventoryPage.  It is where you can
// do things like manage the individual elements in each inventory
// category, add or remove items from said categories (think: a
// product is introduced to the bar or discontinued), and adjust
// inventory pars.

// The information here will modify the information in
// inventory.json, which is where all of the inventory categories
// are contained.  This will eventually probably end up modifying
// things in the database once it is configured.
